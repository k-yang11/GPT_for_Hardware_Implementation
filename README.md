# GPT_for_Hardware_Implementation
This repository supports the 'New Design Approach of Hardware Implementation through Natural Language Entry' article. It includes raw data and supplementary materials including chat history, and source code of the three case studies. We explore the hardware design, striving to simplify hardware specifications through natural language entry. 

The objective of our project is to innovate hardware design, aiming to simplify hardware specifications via natural language entry. We aim to democratize the hardware design process, making it more comprehensible and less intricate, especially for non-specialists.

Repository Content
The repository includes three markdown files, each corresponding to a different case study in our research:

Thread for MobileNet case.md - This thread documents the conversation with GPT-4 while designing MobileNet using our natural language approach. It includes the dialogues, the generated code, and issues encountered during the process.

Thread for RES18 case.md - This thread pertains to the RES18 model implementation, offering insights into our dialogue with GPT-4, the resulting code, and the challenges we faced during the process.

Thread for Systolic Array case.md - This markdown file delves into the design of a Systolic Array, portraying our method to simplify the process through natural language instructions. It showcases the dialogues, generated code, and the obstacles we overcame during the implementation.

How to Use
To utilize this repository, clone the repo and explore the markdown files. These files contain detailed dialogues and source code, providing insights into how we used a conversational AI model (GPT-4) to guide each case study and perform hardware design through natural language entry.
